            make sure that the camera on the sending side is connected to the tunnel and the tunnel to the antenna<br/>
            make sure that the antenna on the receiving side is connected to the tunnel and the tunnel is connected to the computer<br/>
            this component completely borrows its API from the camera so that programs working with the camera can use this component<br/>
